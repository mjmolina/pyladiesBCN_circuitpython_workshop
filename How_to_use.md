If all goes ok, you would be able to donÂ´t see any special screen. 
Go to :

After *click* **Device Simulator Express**, you will need to wait some seconds until appear three options of simulators. 
In our case will work with "CircuitPlayground Express. 
If nothing happen wait a bit more, after a while retry to click again, if not go to the "problems section".


[Extra info]On these images the arrow purple are indicating who different python version working. 
Once appears the different options of simulators, we will select the CircuitPlayground Express and will appear the simulator

In this case, it was running 3.9.1, but run python 3.7+ will work good. 
after all these steps, we will arrive to the final screen divided in two. 
On the left, we have some information about tutorial a official documentation about CircuitPython and it will be the coding area.
On the right on top we should see a microcontroller (CPX)

## Possible problems and how to solve them:

The first arrow shows that the `python2` is running, while on the bottom looks like it is `python 3.7+`.
The version running was `python2.7`and was not working.
