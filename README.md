## Home and cleaning automation with Microcontrollers and CircuitPython

### Workshop description:

When learning and using Python for automation, we usually write applications
that can help us on computer related tasks, like downloading things,
open programs, generating documents, etc, but Python gives us the opportunity
to automate things beyond our computers.

For many years, people have been filling their home with devices that are
based on Microcontrollers, like virtual assistants, smart fridges,
washing machines, security systems, and many others that can be either
programmable, or even replicated with a couple of boards and our Python
knowledge.

During this activity, we will start exploring CircuitPython without the need
of a physical device, using a microcontroller emulator. 
If you are new to the microcontroller world, don’t worry, we will have an
introduction to the main concepts, so we have the base knowledge to start
doing little experiments by ourselves.

After the introduction, you will be able to start programming microcontrollers
using the emulator, and later you will see a couple of real projects
(with real devices!) that could easily be replicated by yourself:
a movement-detector, a low-cost robot cleaner, and a plant watering and
monitoring system.

Outline
- Talk motivation
- Introduction to Microcontrollers and CircuitPython. 
- How to use an emulator for hardware programming.

[Practical part] Let’s code with a CircuitPlayground Express, using an emulator
in VS Code. 
- Temperature sensors.
- Light sensors.
- Proximity sensors.

[Experimental part] Using the code on real devices.

[Demo part] In this section we will see how we can use all this knowledge to
help automating our home. You will see how we can build:
- A movement-detector and alarm.
- Low-cost robot cleaner.
- Watering and monitoring plant system.


*The Practical and Experimental parts, will probably be mixed
for a more dynamic approach. This will depend on the group size*.
