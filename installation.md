For macOS users and Linux there are some alternatives:
- macOS users can use brew (if present), running `brew install python3`,
- Linux users should have python3 installed, already! if not check
  your package manager.

* **Important:** Make sure to add Python to your PATH with the Windows
  installer, with the other OS you should have `python` or `python3`
  already in your path: check it out with `python --version` 
  (or `python3 --version`).
  
  

## Install Visual Studio Code:

Visual Studio Code is necessary to use the Device Simulator Express
and to be able to code microcontroller without the device.

It can be [downloaded](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from their
official website for macOS, Linux or Windows.
(Some Linux users should have it available in the official OS
repository, e.g. `pacman -S code` for Manjaro and Arch)

Extra information to have in consideration:

**Important information:** If you are running `python 3.9` , the Device Simulator Express installation will not work correctly at least that you change de version of one ot the dependency `pillow==7.0.0` to a `pillow==8.1.0` (See: [wesbite](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-devicesimulator/issues/377 )

How to solve it? Modify the pillow version following the path and modify it in the requirement file:

*Unix: .vscode/extensions/ms-python.devicesimulatorexpress-2020.0.36321/out/requirements.txt

*Windows:.vscode\extensions\ms-python.devicesimulatorexpress-2020.0.36321\out\requirements.txt

or use a previous version of python.
