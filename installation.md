For macOS users and Linux there are some alternatives:
- macOS users can use brew (if present), running `brew install python3`,
- Linux users should have python3 installed, already! if not check
  your package manager.

* **Important:** Make sure to add Python to your PATH with the Windows
  installer, with the other OS you should have `python` or `python3`
  already in your path: check it out with `python --version` 
  (or `python3 --version`).
